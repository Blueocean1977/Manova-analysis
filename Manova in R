This code will perform a one-way MANOVA on the menarche dataset, which contains data on the age and height of girls at menarche. The MANOVA results will be summarized, and post-hoc tests will be performed to compare the age and height of girls in different groups.

Here is a brief explanation of the code:

The library(MASS) command loads the MASS package, which contains the manova() function.
The data(menarche) command loads the menarche dataset into the workspace.
The manova(cbind(age, height) ~ group, data = menarche) command performs a one-way MANOVA on the age and height variables, with the group variable as the independent variable.
The summary(manova(cbind(age, height) ~ group, data = menarche)) command summarizes the MANOVA results.
The pairwise.t.test(menarche$age, menarche$group, p.adjust.method = "holm") command performs pairwise t-tests on the age variable, with the group variable as the independent variable, and the Holm-Bonferroni correction is used to adjust for multiple comparisons.
The pairwise.t.test(menarche$height, menarche$group, p.adjust.method = "holm") command performs pairwise t-tests on the height variable, with the group variable as the independent variable, and the Holm-Bonferroni correction is used to adjust for multiple comparisons.
